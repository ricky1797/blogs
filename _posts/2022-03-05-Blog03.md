I have been forgetting to submit my blogs before the deadline which has been a complete mistake on my part. This week , me and Dan continued to study APIs and how we can incoprate them with our idea within the project. When doing research on APIs they seemed very accessible however it really has been unlucky with getting permissions to use the already set APIs. We have been working on making a DB with mongodb and using node to reach for the data but have yet to be successful given the situation that Node JS is a new language to us. I expect that by our next presentation we will have something sorted out and will be able to demosntrate how to use mongodb and create a basic API to pull the name of the product or price. It seems a little complicated to create everything. Another task that we have been working on this week has been to finish the final touches on the front end to finally start working on the mobile friendly aspect of our website.
