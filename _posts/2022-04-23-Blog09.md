After figuring out alot about APIs, I was able to properly render the information that I want displayed ont the website. This week I focused on working up the finishing touches in the front end and incorporating more API stuff into other parts of the website. I have so far worked on most of the CSS and organized the files a little better. I want to add a little more details on the site such as animation and transitions on certain sections of the site. I think I will be working on that for the rest of the week until its all Polished up. I am glad I figured out the API stuff and have been helping the rest of the team to catch up and help with it since most of them want to
practice and learn java. Another thing I did this week , was look more into object mapping because it seems that I will be dealing with arrays for the most part as how I did with my first attempt.
