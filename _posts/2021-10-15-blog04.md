I took a step back from learning to code on the side for a bit because this week. I have been working on my ansible lab assignment. It is an assignment that I have not gotten to understand. This assignment definitely feels like a composition of lab #1 and lab #2. I am in the beginning because I am unsure if I can use the command to test that includes “localhost” even if i'm running in a container. I do not want to mess around with my system files. The logic of having to create a Dockerfile that includes all the installation commands to install ansible. And the playbooks are created afterwards. I am just having difficulty remembering how to create the files needed and how to input the right commands. I have never really had to deal with IT related stuff so this is definitely new to me. I'm glad the assignment is due in the night so hopefully tomorrow's class helps me do better in order for me to finish the assignment on time. Im sure that it is something so simple that I am over looking.
