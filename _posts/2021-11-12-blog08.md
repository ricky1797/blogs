This week, I have started with the Front End development of our Project . I have some experience with React in fact I have already made some websites in the past. The challenges that
I created for myself in doing a task I already am familiar with is to learn to have prettier code and want to be able to make the website be more modern in the sense of design
by having similar features apple has on their site. React is a very good framework to really boost the way a website is and make it more appealing. I enjoy coding and I really
want to have proper practice because beginner code is very messy. I expect the front end to be at least have the skeleton of the website done by presentation time. It has been good to 
not have assignments at the moment so we can really focus and build the best to our ability.
