I forgot to submit last weeks blog due to the holidays and lost track of time. This week however I have been focusing on animation and on how to make our website more accessible and more appealing instead of having it be very simplistic. My goal is to make the website up to par and look as if a big company
designed it. When i started with React I felt completely lost but now I have been practicing by going to old projects and debug them and make the code more prettier. I have been using stlyed components and it makes everything so simple with it being plug and play. The front end will be somewhat complete by the end of the semester. I have yet to venture into incorporating APIs to include the images and data but one thing Ive learned is that finished a good product takes time. So I am taking my time making sure everything that is my responsibility is done right.
