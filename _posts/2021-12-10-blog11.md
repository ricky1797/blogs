This week , I was focused on working on my part of the project, I mainly had been practicing with APIs and messing around with them in order to understand them and incorporate them into our website. I was able to get some queries running to the API and was able to fetch the data successfully with no issues
However , the syntax once transferred to react is different and I have not be able to successfully incorprate it because I cannot fetch from the api if I "press" the button to initiate the command. As a group we feel confident with the portion we have finished. I did not help much on the IT side but we were troubleshooting each other for about 2 hours trying to get stuff installed and get our EC2 instance to run in order to have that ready for our presentation. It has been a very tedious time trying to debug and trying to learn the things I will be adding.
