I was finally able to get the API stuff working. It took me about a week to get it going, the issue that I was having
was that I was able to console log the arrays of data but I was unable to fetch the same data and render it on the frontend
After learning a bit about object mapping and arrays I thought I had it, it was only after I also incorprated Usestates was the
data showing properly. In order to have something to present , I created a rough table design and displayed the data accordingly.
Now all I will be focusing on will be doing the final touches on the website and make it more smooth it alot of aspects.
Getting the API stuff down , it will be easy to add more functionality to our website.
