I have not been able to be getting to get any sort of API working or have been able to get the webscraping portion working. I have decided to finish some more front end work and take a small break from the backend stuff to try it again with a fresh mind again. Big portion of our website will be depending on the API and data fetching so we will have to have that ready by the end of this week in order to show there has been progress overall. Recently the team has been going through some hard time and gotten out of focus but we will be delivering an amazing project by the end of the semester.
