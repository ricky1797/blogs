This week I focused heavily on getting the backend to work. I have started with webscraping and have been able to pull
some data from the website I used to scrape. I am new to this in general so I knew I was going to encounter some problems along the way.
In order for the scraped data to be sent somewhere it has to be saved into an array and label them accordingly however my array does not show properly. All of the values are stored into the first variable. This has taken more time than I have wished to but I shall figure it out by next week. With the current data that I have been able to save, ill be now focusing on it appearing in the front end. This past week , I mainly focused on learning the basics on webscraping and which approach would have been a better fit .
