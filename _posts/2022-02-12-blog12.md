This week , I worked on learning some Node JS in order to incorporate it with our group project. Most of the front end is finished except for the empty spots in where the components that are needed to work with the APIs we plan on using. It has been very difficult to get
the access keys that we need in order to reach the sites Databases. I have looked at alternatives and they also have been difficult to approach. For the front End however I found AOS animation which we will be using to add animation throughout the site to make it top tier and make it more appealing and interactive to the user.
