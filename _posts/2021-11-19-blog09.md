This week, I focused on creating the skeleton for for the team's website.
Some challenges that I faced was learning a new way to write React. I ventured in to React styled components and it makes code more appealiong and much nicer.
Everything is separated in components so that makes them reusable. Reusable components are easier because if I need a button or a div , I can just call it from another file where the code is located. It has been a little challenging to create a react app while co coding it with some one else. Our code is not similar and it can make debugging a little hard. Howver I feel confident about our progress so far. I took this week to practice using useState() to add animation to the webite , and it make more up to par with top tier websites like apple and tesla.
