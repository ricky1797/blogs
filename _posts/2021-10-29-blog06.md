I unfortunately missed last week's blog due to some poor time management. This week we got to partner with our project teams and start discussing the goals and expectations we have for the project. One very important task that I set myself to do this week was to learn golang. Since golang is one of the newer programming languages out there. The team decided it was best for our interest to learn some go. I have not been able to fully be exposed to it but from what i can tell it is a mixture of many languages, I found it interesting that this was because go is suppose to be faster in terms of processing from what I understand. Since we are barely in the first steps of the project , I have only looked into the very basics of go , to see if maybe it was a little too much to handle at the moment. Before tomorrow's presentation , I am in charge of finding any rest APIs that we could use for our project. Finding APIs have not been easy given that this sort of information is protected by the online stores. If we are unable to find APIs , then our second option is to create some sort of web scraper to fetch that information and be able to use it
