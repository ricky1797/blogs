For my first post, I will be talking about my experience with installing jekyll and setting up my github pages. At first the assignment seemed pretty straightforward and I decided to not really look into guides or look up youtube videos. For about 3 hours I was trying to figure it out and I couldnâ€™t. The issue that I was having is that I was creating the github pages, and I had both jekyll and ruby installed by default since I decided to do this class on my mac due to mac being slightly friendlier with docker. After trying it for a while, I decided to go on youtube and look at some guides. I realized that my mistake was that I was never really creating the static website using jekyll. After watching the tutorials, it was really straightforward. I am excited to learn a little about markdown. My goal this year is to explore and venture through different languages to see what I like and see how I can apply them in the future depending on my needs. In the following days I will be looking at tutorials about themes and will be changing some aspects from the default template. For my blog posts , I am not sure if this is how it works but I am using VScode to write my posts and I am committing and pushing changes through github desktop. It seems to work however I am not sure if this is the proper way.
